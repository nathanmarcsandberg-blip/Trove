      <section class="how-section intro-section">
        <h1 class="hero-title">Trove is an Investment Platform Like No Other</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
          We provide all the features you’d expect from a digital investment platform with a key difference:
          <strong>we want to grow with you</strong>. Our unique offering values long‑term investors and relentlessly seeks
          to build a yield‑bearing crypto treasury.
        </p>

      <!-- Long-Term Investors Section -->
      <section class="how-section long-term-section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Long Term Investors</h2>
        <p>
          We firmly believe that short‑term investors and traders shouldn’t be eligible for dividends. While companies set
          deadlines for ownership to qualify, we extend this to 60 days. At Trove you only begin earning dividends after
          holding for at least 60 days. This structure ensures:
        </p>
        <ul class="how-list">
          <li>Existing members always receive extra dividends as new members join.</li>
          <li>Improved loyalty across the platform.</li>
          <li>Extra revenue from early‑unlock fees, which further grows our treasury.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you need to access your earnings sooner, you can unlock your maturity early for a small fee—this fee goes
          directly to growing the company treasury, benefiting the community.

      <!-- Crypto Treasury Section -->

        <p>
          Half of all revenue generated at Trove goes towards building our crypto treasury. Each month, we deploy new
          capital across a variety of staking pools—including BTC, ETH and stablecoins—to compound value.

          Rewards from the treasury are paid monthly. <strong>90% of yields</strong> are distributed to our loyal members based on
          portfolio size, length of membership and activeness. The <strong>remaining 10%</strong> is raffled off randomly to our
          community, giving everyone the chance to win big.
